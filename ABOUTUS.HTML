            <h3>What is Real Estate</h3>

            <p>Real estate is defined as the land and any permanent structures, like a home, or improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made.

                Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.</p>

                <h3>Uderstanding of Realestate</h3>

            <p>The terms land, real estate, and real property are often used interchangeably, but there are distinctions.

                Land refers to the earth's surface down to the center of the earth and upward to the airspace above, including the trees, minerals, and water. The physical characteristics of land include its immobility, indestructibility, and uniqueness, where each parcel of land differs geographically.</p>
